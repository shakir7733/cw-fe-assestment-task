## Code Refinement Assessment - Changes Made

## Global/Architectural Improvements

1.  **Folder Structure & Modularity:**
    - **Issue:** Monolithic `App.tsx` and lack of clear component organization.
    - **Fix:** Established a modular folder structure (`components/layout`, `components/sections`, `components/feature`, `contexts`, `lib`, `styles`) for better separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
2.  **Centralized Search State (Context API):**
    - **Issue:** Prop drilling `onSearch` function through multiple components.
    - **Fix:** Introduced `src/contexts/search-context.tsx` with `SearchProvider` and `useSearch` hook. This centralizes `searchTerm`, `setSearchTerm`, and `triggerSearch` state/logic, making it globally accessible and reducing prop drilling.
3.  **Tailwind CSS Configuration & Theming:**
    - **Issue:** Direct use of generic color classes (e.g., `bg-background`, `bg-muted`), limiting theming flexibility.
    - **Fix:** Configured `tailwind.config.ts` to extend the theme with **semantic colors** (e.g., `background`, `muted`, `primary`) updated to CSS variables. `src/index.css` now defines these variables and provides a robust theming foundation aligned with Shadcn/UI.
4.  **Static Data Management:**
    - **Issue:** `useState` used for static `tags` array in `App.tsx`.
    - **Fix:** Moved static `TRENDING_TAGS` to `src/lib/constants.ts` to improve data management and avoid unnecessary state.

### `App.tsx`

1.  **Component Orchestration:**
    - **Issue:** Contains multiple direct component imports and local state for `tags`.
    - **Fix:** Simplified by wrapping content with `SearchProvider` and importing components from their new, organized paths. Removed `tags` state as it's now a constant.

## `Header.tsx`

1.  **Search Input Functionality:**
    - **Issue:** Basic search input with no visual feedback or extended functionality.
    - **Fix:** Integrated Shadcn/UI's `Popover` to display real-time feedback (loading, results) for search. Connected input to `SearchContext` to manage `searchTerm` and trigger search.
2.  **Debouncing Search Input:**
    - **Issue:** No debouncing for search input, potentially leading to excessive search calls on every keystroke.
    - **Fix:** Implemented `useDebounce` hook to delay search execution by 500ms after user stops typing, improving performance and API efficiency.
3.  **Dynamic Popover Content:**
    - **Issue:** No mechanism to show search status or results directly in the header.
    - **Fix:** Added state for `isLoading`, `searchResults`, and `searchExecutedFor`. `renderPopoverContent` dynamically displays "Start typing...", "Loading...", "No results", or actual results based on current state.
4.  **Pixel Perfection & Styling:**
    - **Issue:** Minor misalignments and hardcoded sizes.
    - **Fix:** Added styling inside the wrapper container, increased input width (`w-48 md:w-54 lg:w-60`), and applied semantic Tailwind color classes (`bg-input`, `text-foreground`, `placeholder:text-muted-foreground`).
5.  **Accessibility (Header Search):**
    - **Issue:** Missing `aria-label` for global search input.
    - **Fix:** Added `aria-label="Global search input"` for screen reader users.

## `HeroSection.tsx`

1.  **Prop Drilling Elimination:**
    - **Issue:** Required `onSearch` prop passed from `App.tsx`.
    - **Fix:** Removed `onSearch` prop as `SearchInputGroup` now consumes search context directly.
2.  **Image Accessibility:**
    - **Issue:** Missing `alt` attribute for `hero-bg.png`.
    - **Fix:** Added a descriptive `alt` attribute for improved accessibility.

## `SearchInputGroup.tsx`

1.  **Context Consumption:**
    - **Issue:** Directly accepted `initialValue` and `onSearch` props.
    - **Fix:** Refactored to consume `searchTerm`, `setSearchTerm`, and `triggerSearch` directly from `SearchContext` via `useSearch` hook. Removed `initialValue` state as it's now context-driven.
2.  **Event Handling:**
    - **Issue:** Original `useEffect` triggered `onSearch` on every `innerValue` change.
    - **Fix:** Changed search trigger to explicit `onClick` on the button and `onKeyPress` for "Enter" key, using `useCallback` for memoized handlers.
3.  **Pixel Perfection & Styling:**
    - **Issue:** Input background color mismatch and slight padding/rounding discrepancies.
    - **Fix:** Changed `bg-black` to `bg-input`, adjusted `px-2 py-2` on container and button padding, and specified `h-10` for input height.

## `TagList.tsx`

1.  **Interactive Tags & Context Integration:**
    - **Issue:** `Badge` components were display-only `div`s with `cursor-pointer`, lacking interactive semantics.
    - **Fix:** Wrapped each `Badge` within a `button` element to provide proper interactive semantics. Added an `onClick` handler to `button` that uses `useSearch` to call `setSearchTerm` and `triggerSearch` with the clicked tag, enhancing user experience.
2.  **Accessibility (Tags):**
    - **Issue:** Clickable badges were not accessible via keyboard and lacked `aria-label`.
    - **Fix:** Used `button` elements and added `aria-label` for each tag button, ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
3.  **Semantic HTML:**
    - **Issue:** Title was a generic `div`.
    - **Fix:** Changed title `div` to `h2` for improved semantic document structure.
4.  **Styling Consistency:**
    - **Issue:** Minor inconsistencies in badge styling.
    - **Fix:** Applied more precise `text-sm px-3 py-1.5 rounded-full font-medium` for pixel-perfect match and used semantic `bg-muted` and `text-foreground`.
